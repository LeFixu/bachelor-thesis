Es wird aufgezeigt, wie sich Frauen und Männer auf die verschiedenen Bereiche des Arbeitsmarkts (z.B. in Branchen) verteilen und wie hoch die Lohnunterschiede in diesen Bereichen ausfallen. Der zweite Teil widmet sich schliesslich der statistischen Erklärung der Lohnunterschiede: Mithilfe ökonometrischer Methoden werden die beobachteten Lohndifferenzen in einen erklärten und einen unerklärten Anteil zerlegt.},

abstract = {To attract unsuspecting readers, news article headlines and abstracts are often written with speculative sentences or clauses. Male dominance in the news is very evident, whereas females are seen as “eye candy” or “inferior”, and are underrepresented and under-examined within the same news categories as their male counterparts. In this paper, we present an initial study on gender bias in news abstracts in two large English news datasets used for news recommendation and news classification. We perform three large-scale, yet effective text-analysis fairness measurements on 296,965 news abstracts. In particular, to our knowledge we construct two of the largest benchmark datasets of possessive (gender-specific and gender-neutral) nouns and attribute (career-related and family-related) words datasets1 which we will release to foster both bias and fairness research aid in developing fair NLP models to eliminate the paradox of gender bias. Our studies demonstrate that females are immensely marginalized and suffer from socially-constructed biases in the news. This paper individually devises a methodology whereby news content can be analyzed on a large scale utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques from machine learning (ML) to discover both implicit and explicit gender biases.},

abstract = {Professional news media organizations have always touted the importance that they give to multiple perspectives. However, in practice, the traditional approach to all-sides has favored people in the dominant culture. Hence it has come under ethical critique under the new norms of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). When DEI is applied to journalism, it goes beyond conventional notions of impartiality and bias and instead democratizes the journalistic practice of sourcing -- who is quoted or interviewed, who is not, how often, from which demographic group, gender, and so forth. There is currently no real-time or on-demand tool in the hands of reporters to analyze the persons they quote. In this paper, we present DIANES, a DEI Audit Toolkit for News Sources. It consists of a natural language processing pipeline on the backend to extract quotes, speakers, titles, and organizations from news articles in real time. On the frontend, DIANES offers the WordPress plugins, a Web monitor, and a DEI annotation API service, to help news media monitor their own quoting patterns and push themselves towards DEI norms.},

In this study we consider whether commenting on published work is also gendered. Using all the comments published over a 16-year period in PNAS (N = 869) and Science (N = 481), we find that there is a gender gap in the authorship of comment letters: women are less likely than men to comment on published academic research. This disparity is greater than gender differences in the publication of research articles. There is also a gendered pattern in commenting: women comment writers are relatively less likely to engage with men’s research. If left unaddressed, these patterns in academic commenting could impede scholarly exchange between men and women and further marginalize women within the scientific community.},

In order to develop adequate expertise in a given field of study, students and early career scientists must be strategic in what they decide to read. Here we propose using citation network analysis to characterize the literature topology of a given area. We used the human aggression literature as our example. Our citation network analysis identified 15 research communities on aggression. The five largest communities were: “media and video games”, “stress, traits and aggression”, “rumination and displaced aggression”, “role of testosterone”, and “social aggression”. We examined the growth of these research communities over time, and we used graph theoretic approaches to identify the most influential papers within each community and the “bridging” articles that linked distinct communities to one another. Finally, we also examined whether our citation network analysis would help mitigate gender bias relative to focusing on total citation counts. The percentage of articles with women first authors doubled when identifying influential articles by community structure versus citation count. Our approach of characterizing literature topologies using citation network analysis may provide a valuable resource for psychological scientists by outlining research communities and their growth over time, identifying influential papers within each community (including bridging papers), and providing opportunities to increase gender equity in the field.},

We find evidence of a glass ceiling for women, but racial inequalities among men do not follow a similar pattern.

abstract = {Journalists, fact-checkers, academics, and community media are overwhelmed in their attempts to support communities suffering from gender-, race- and ethnicity-targeted information ecosystem threats, including but not limited to misinformation, hate speech, weaponized controversy and online-to-offline harassment. Yet, for a plethora of reasons, minoritized groups are underserved by current approaches to combat such threats. In this panel, we will present and discuss the challenges and open problems facing such communities and the researchers hoping to serve them. We will also discuss the current state-of-the-art as well as the most promising future directions, both within IR specifically, across Computer Science more broadly, as well as that requiring transdisciplinary and cross-sectoral collaborations. The panel will attract both IR practitioners and researchers and include at least one panelist outside of IR, with unique expertise in this space.},

    abstract = {Cancer research in the news is often associated with sensationalised and inaccurate reporting, which may give rise to false hopes and expectations. The role of study selection for cancer-related news stories is an important but less commonly acknowledged issue, as the outcomes of primary research are generally less reliable than those of meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Few studies have investigated the quality of research that makes the news and no previous analyses of the proportions of primary and secondary research in the news have been found in the literature. We analysed distribution of study types, research sources, reporting quality, gender bias, and national bias in online news reports by four major news outlets in USA, UK and Australia over six-months. We measured significant variation in reporting quality and observed biases in many aspects of cancer research reporting, including the types of study selected for coverage, the spectrum of cancer types, gender of scientists, and geographical source of research represented. We discuss the implications of these findings for guiding accurate, contextual reporting of cancer research, which is critical in helping the public understand complex science, appreciate the outcomes of publicly-funded research, maintain trust, and assist informed decision-making. The striking gender bias observed may compromise high-quality coverage of research by limiting diversity of opinion, reinforces stereotypes and skews public visibility and recognition towards male scientists. Our findings provide useful guidelines for scientists and journalists alike to consider in providing the most informative and accurate reporting of research.},

    abstract = {Feminist news media researchers have long contended that masculine news values shape journalists’ quotidian decisions about what is newsworthy. As a result, it is argued, topics and issues traditionally regarded as primarily of interest and relevance to women are routinely marginalised in the news, while men’s views and voices are given privileged space. When women do show up in the news, it is often as “eye candy,” thus reinforcing women’s value as sources of visual pleasure rather than residing in the content of their views. To date, evidence to support such claims has tended to be based on small-scale, manual analyses of news content. In this article, we report on findings from our large-scale, data-driven study of gender representation in online English language news media. We analysed both words and images so as to give a broader picture of how gender is represented in online news. The corpus of news content examined consists of 2,353,652 articles collected over a period of six months from more than 950 different news outlets. From this initial dataset, we extracted 2,171,239 references to named persons and 1,376,824 images resolving the gender of names and faces using automated computational methods. We found that males were represented more often than females in both images and text, but in proportions that changed across topics, news outlets and mode. Moreover, the proportion of females was consistently higher in images than in text, for virtually all topics and news outlets; women were more likely to be represented visually than they were mentioned as a news actor or source. Our large-scale, data-driven analysis offers important empirical evidence of macroscopic patterns in news content concerning the way men and women are represented.},
