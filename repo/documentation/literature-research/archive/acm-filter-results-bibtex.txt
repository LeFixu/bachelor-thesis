abstract = {To attract unsuspecting readers, news article headlines and abstracts are often written with speculative sentences or clauses. Male dominance in the news is very evident, whereas females are seen as “eye candy” or “inferior”, and are underrepresented and under-examined within the same news categories as their male counterparts. In this paper, we present an initial study on gender bias in news abstracts in two large English news datasets used for news recommendation and news classification. We perform three large-scale, yet effective text-analysis fairness measurements on 296,965 news abstracts. In particular, to our knowledge we construct two of the largest benchmark datasets of possessive (gender-specific and gender-neutral) nouns and attribute (career-related and family-related) words datasets1 which we will release to foster both bias and fairness research aid in developing fair NLP models to eliminate the paradox of gender bias. Our studies demonstrate that females are immensely marginalized and suffer from socially-constructed biases in the news. This paper individually devises a methodology whereby news content can be analyzed on a large scale utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques from machine learning (ML) to discover both implicit and explicit gender biases.},

abstract = {The New York Times published an op-ed by Anita Hill [3] suggesting that women in tech consider class action to remedy the gender bias that is increasingly being reported in the mass-media. This panel raises the question "what are we doing in undergraduate programs to reduce the 'Mad Men', 'Brogrammer' culture she describes that is increasingly being reported in the popular press. Part of our mission as educators is to develop professional behavior so that our students entering the workforce not only understand what it means to act professionally, but understand that it is their responsibility to actively push back on the existing bias within the tech culture. As moderator Ursula Wolz brings a depth of insight from 40 years of industrial and academic experience, including a National Science Foundation project to broaden participation in computing [5]. She does not believe this problem can be solved through quantitative data collection on who does well in computer science, but that SIGCSE needs to begin to collect good stories (ala Sally Fincher [2]) on what constitute best practices to support diversity. The panelists present a range of perspectives that have the potential to establish new cultural norms in the single most influential industry in our economy.},

abstract = {In film directing, a bias towards the representation of a particular gender can cause the audience to form a distorted stereotype of the gender role. The Bechdel test has been widely used to objectively judge the existence of such bias in films. However, because its analysis is based solely on the script of a film, the Bechdel test is incapable of considering the broad spectrum of bias that films can have as a visual medium. This study proposes a more comprehensive analysis system that quantifies the degree of bias in the visual representations of female and male characters in commercial films. By analyzing the image frames of a movie using the latest image analysis techniques, a total of 40 films were analyzed based on 8 quantitative indices. The result demonstrates that there exists a statistically significant difference in the visual representation of female and male characters. Specifically, female characters showed lower values in emotional diversity, spatial occupancy, and temporal occupancy compared to male characters in commercial films. Further, female characters were less likely to wear eyeglasses and also appeared more in static scenes, such as indoors.},

It is a reality supported by statistics, but by taking realistic measures for medium and long term, we can change the current situation. The present paper conducts an extensive study on women engaged in study or work at MSc, PhD and academic staff level in the CS field. Multiple factors that support or prevent women in Romania from attending advanced studies or pursuing an academic career in Computer Science have been identified and analyzed. Thus, through the obtained results, we aim to make an impact on decision-makers at the local level of higher education institutions, while good practices can constitute a starting point for other institutions interested in tackling this gender gap.},

abstract = {Medical systems in general, and patient treatment decisions and outcomes in particular, can be affected by bias based on gender and other demographic elements. As language models are increasingly applied to medicine, there is a growing interest in building algorithmic fairness into processes impacting patient care. Much of the work addressing this question has focused on biases encoded in language models—statistical estimates of the relationships between concepts derived from distant reading of corpora. Building on this work, we investigate how differences in gender-specific word frequency distributions and language models interact with regards to bias. We identify and remove gendered language from two clinical-note datasets and describe a new debiasing procedure using BERT-based gender classifiers. We show minimal degradation in health condition classification tasks for low- to medium-levels of dataset bias removal via data augmentation. Finally, we compare the bias semantically encoded in the language models with the bias empirically observed in health records. This work outlines an interpretable approach for using data augmentation to identify and reduce biases in natural language processing pipelines.},

abstract = {The problem of social influence maximization is widely applicable in designing viral campaigns, news dissemination, or medical aid. State-of-the-art algorithms often select “early adopters” that are most central in a network unfortunately mirroring or exacerbating historical biases and leaving under-represented communities out of the loop. Through a theoretical model of biased networks, we characterize the intricate relationship between diversity and efficiency, which sometimes may be at odds but may also reinforce each other. Most importantly, we find a mathematically proven analytical condition under which more equitable choices of early adopters lead simultaneously to fairer outcomes and larger outreach. Analysis of data on the DBLP network confirms that our condition is often met in real networks. We design and test a set of algorithms leveraging the network structure to optimize the diffusion of a message while avoiding to create disparate impact among participants based on their demographics, such as gender or race.},

abstract = {In today's media landscape, emotionally charged topics including issues related to politics, religion, or gender can lead to the formation of filter bubbles, echo chambers, and subsequently to strong polarization. An effective way to help people break out of their bubble is engaging with other perspectives. When caught in a filter bubble, however, it can be hard to find an opposed conversation partner in one's social surroundings to discuss a particular topic with. Also, such conversations can be socially awkward and are, therefore, rather avoided. In this project, we aim to train different chat-bots to become highly opinionated on specific topics (e.g., pro/against gun laws) and provide the opportunity to discuss political views with a highly biased opponent.},

abstract = {Professional news media organizations have always touted the importance that they give to multiple perspectives. However, in practice, the traditional approach to all-sides has favored people in the dominant culture. Hence it has come under ethical critique under the new norms of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). When DEI is applied to journalism, it goes beyond conventional notions of impartiality and bias and instead democratizes the journalistic practice of sourcing -- who is quoted or interviewed, who is not, how often, from which demographic group, gender, and so forth. There is currently no real-time or on-demand tool in the hands of reporters to analyze the persons they quote. In this paper, we present DIANES, a DEI Audit Toolkit for News Sources. It consists of a natural language processing pipeline on the backend to extract quotes, speakers, titles, and organizations from news articles in real time. On the frontend, DIANES offers the WordPress plugins, a Web monitor, and a DEI annotation API service, to help news media monitor their own quoting patterns and push themselves towards DEI norms.},

abstract = {Several prominent studies have shown that the imbalanced on-screen exposure of observable phenotypic traits like gender and skin-tone in movies, TV shows, live telecasts, and other visual media can reinforce gender and racial stereotypes in society. Researchers and human rights organizations alike have long been calling to make media producers more aware of such stereotypes. While awareness among media producers is growing, balancing the presence of different phenotypes in a video requires substantial manual effort and can typically only be done in the post-production phase. The task becomes even more challenging in the case of a live telecast where video producers must make instantaneous decisions with no post-production phase to refine or revert a decision. In this paper, we propose Screen-Balancer, an interactive tool that assists media producers in balancing the presence of different phenotypes in a live telecast. The design of Screen-Balancer is informed by a field study conducted in a professional live studio. Screen-Balancer analyzes the facial features of the actors to determine phenotypic traits using facial detection packages; it then facilitates real-time visual feedback for interactive moderation of gender and skin-tone distributions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a user study with 20 participants and asked them to compose live telecasts from a set of video streams simulating different camera angles, and featuring several male and female actors with different skin-tones. The study revealed that the participants were able to reduce the difference of screen times of male and female actors by 43%, and that of light-skinned and dark-skinned actors by 44%, thus showing the promise and potential of using such a tool in commercial production systems.},

abstract = {Lack of diversity, especially gender inequality and social background are some global problems in different sectors but especially latent in the context of the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering (and the recently added concept of Arts), and Mathematics (STEAM), from primary school to university level and, therefore, labor market. When we talk about diversity, we are worried about attracting representative people from all sectors of society, different cultures, disabilities, ethnic groups, gender or sexual orientation. Besides, the low diversity in STEAM studies has been identified as one of the main problems that needs to be solved in order to reduce the diversity gap that exists in these sectors. The CreaSTEAM project addresses this, not only from the gender gap perspective, but also with a broad approach covering diversity and social inclusion as a way to create inclusive spaces in which to promote STEAM. The project aims to provide an actualized map of the resources focused on the reduction of the diversity gap using STEAM approaches and to select from these resources better solutions to create a framework to implement STEAM-Labs into secondary schools. The STEAM-Labs, as a main innovation of the project, merge the solutions that we can find in FAB-Labs, MEDIA-Labs, and USER-Labs. Our approach is focused on the creation of good practices in these spaces in order to promote diversity in STEAM, where diversity also covers gender equity, and social inclusion for promotion of STEAM vocations.},

abstract = {Context: Addressing women's under-representation in the software industry, a widely recognized concern, requires attracting as well as retaining more women. Hearing from women practitioners, particularly those positioned in multi-cultural settings, about their challenges and and adopting their lived experienced solutions can support the design of programs to resolve the under-representation issue. Goal: We investigated the challenges women face in global software development teams, particularly what motivates women to leave their company; how those challenges might break down according to demographics; and strategies to mitigate the identified challenges. Method: To achieve this goal, we conducted an exploratory case study in Ericsson, a global technology company. We surveyed 94 women and employed mixed-methods to analyze the data. Results: Our findings reveal that women face socio-cultural challenges, including work-life balance issues, benevolent and hostile sexism, lack of recognition and peer parity, impostor syndrome, glass ceiling bias effects, the prove-it-again phenomenon, and the maternal wall. The participants of our research provided different suggestions to address/mitigate the reported challenges, including sabbatical policies, flexibility of location and time, parenthood support, soft skills training for managers, equality of payment and opportunities between genders, mentoring and role models to support career growth, directives to hire more women, inclusive groups and events, women's empowerment, and recognition for women's success. The framework of challenges and suggestions can inspire further initiatives both in academia and industry to onboard and retain women.Women represent less than 24% of employees in software development industry and experience various types of prejudice and bias. Even in companies that care about Diversity &amp; Inclusion, "untying the mooring ropes" of socio-cultural problems is hard. Hearing from women, especially those working in a multi-cultural organization, about their challenges and adopting their suggestions can be vital to design programs and resolve the under-representation issue. In this work we work closely with a large software development organization which invests and believes in diversity and inclusion. We listened to women and the challenges they face in global software development teams of this company and what these women suggest reduce the problems and increase retention. Our research showed that women face work-life balance issues and encounter invisible barriers that prevent them from rising to top positions. They also suffer micro-aggression and sexism, need to show competence constantly, be supervised in essential tasks, and receive less work after becoming mothers. Moreover, women miss having more female colleagues, lack self-confidence and recognition. The women from the company suggested sabbatical policies, the flexibility of location and time, parenthood support, soft skills training for managers, equality of opportunities, role models to support career growth, directives to hire more women, support groups, and more interaction between women, inclusive groups and events, women's empowerment by publishing their success stories in media and recognizing their achievements. Our results had been shared with the company Human Resources department and management and they considered the diagnosis helpful and will work on actions to mitigate the challenges that women still perceive.},

News stakeholders such as communications researchers, journalists, and media monitoring organizations are interested in the visual content of cable news, especially who is on-screen. Manual analysis, however, is labor intensive and limits the size of prior studies. We conduct a large-scale, quantitative analysis of the faces in a decade of cable news video from the top three US cable news networks (CNN, FOX, and MSNBC), totaling 244,038 hours between January 2010 and July 2019. Our work uses technologies such as automatic face and gender recognition to measure the "screen time" of faces and to enable visual analysis and exploration at scale. Our analysis method gives insight into a broad set of socially relevant topics. For instance, male-presenting faces receive much more screen time than female-presenting faces (2.4x in 2010, 1.9x in 2019). To make our dataset and annotations accessible, we release a public interface at https://tvnews.stanford.edu that allows the general public to write queries and to perform their own analyses.},

Unsurprisingly, multiple commercial APIs, each with different levels of accuracy and fairness, are now publicly available for sentiment detection. Users can easily incorporate these APIs in their applications. While combining inputs from multiple modalities or black-box models for increasing accuracy is commonly studied in multimedia computing literature, there has been little work on combining different modalities for increasingfairness of the resulting decision. In this work, we audit multiple commercial sentiment detection APIs for the gender bias in two-actor news headlines settings and report on the level of bias observed. Next, we propose a "Flexible Fair Regression" approach, which ensures satisfactory accuracy and fairness by jointly learning from multiple black-box models. The results pave way for fair yet accurate sentiment detectors for multiple applications.},

abstract = {While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are deriving the major innovations through their powerful automation, we are also witnessing the peril behind automation as a form of bias, such as automated racism, gender bias, and adversarial bias. As the societal impact of DNNs grows, finding an effective way to steer DNNs to align their behavior with the human mental model has become indispensable in realizing fair and accountable models. While establishing the way to adjust DNNs to "think like humans'' is in pressing need, there have been few approaches aiming to capture how "humans would think'' when DNNs introduce biased reasoning in seeing a new instance. We propose Interactive Attention Alignment (IAA), a framework that uses the methods for visualizing model attention, such as saliency maps, as an interactive medium that humans can leverage to unveil the cases of DNN's biased reasoning and directly adjust the attention. To realize more effective human-steerable DNNs than state-of-the-art, IAA introduces two novel devices. First, IAA uses Reasonability Matrix to systematically identify and adjust the cases of biased attention. Second, IAA applies GRADIA, a computational pipeline designed for effectively applying the adjusted attention to jointly maximize attention quality and prediction accuracy. We evaluated Reasonability Matrix in Study 1 and GRADIA in Study 2 in the gender classification problem. In Study 1, we found applying Reasonability Matrix in bias detection can significantly improve the perceived quality of model attention from human eyes than not applying Reasonability Matrix. In Study 2, we found using GRADIA significantly improves (1) the human-assessed perceived quality of model attention and (2) model performance in scenarios where the training samples are limited. Based on our observation in the two studies, we present implications for future design in the problem space of social computing and interactive data annotation toward achieving a human-centered steerable AI.},

abstract = {In some developing countries, widows are looked down upon and are often considered inauspicious especially in rural regions. Some societies even consider them and their issues invisible. This paper presents findings from a qualitative study focused on understanding how technology could facilitate entrepreneurial and DIY activities of widows from rural Sri Lanka. We conducted semi-structured interviews and field observations with thirteen widows from low socio-economic backgrounds, who were involved in various small-scale entrepreneurial activities. Our findings showed three central aspects associated with their entrepreneurial activities which can be supported through technology: initial stages of entrepreneurship, balancing work with life, and dealing with exploitations. This paper explores how gender inequality in a social context affects marginalized women in rural Sri Lanka in conducting their entrepreneurial efforts. In particular, we highlight resilient practices that the participants apply to support their entrepreneurial activities. With an "assets-based approach" we conclude by providing implications for policymakers, media, and HCI practitioners to support this inbuilt resilience by leveraging their current assets.},

abstract = {It is common for individuals with diverse demographic backgrounds to collaborate through computer-mediated communication (CMC) technologies. Groups with internal diversity are typically considered to be advantageous to group performance due to the presence of different perspectives and the potential to stimulate new ideas. However, intergroup conflicts can also occur in diverse groups, especially for groups with imbalanced composition. Previous studies have pointed out that minority members often suffer from unequal participation and performance pressure, which may further decrease group outcome. Since CMC tools facilitate online collaboration, it is necessary to understand how group composition interacts with the affordances of CMC tools on group collaboration. In this study, we tested three gender compositions (female-majority, equal-gender-composition, male-majority) with two communication contexts (video-text, text-only) and found that both gender composition and communication medium influenced group collaboration. Design implications for online collaboration are provided based on our findings.},

abstract = {Online social networks have become a crucial medium to disseminate the latest political, commercial, and social information. Users with high visibility are often selected as seeds to spread information and affect their adoption in target groups. We study how gender differences and similarities can impact the information spreading process. Using a large-scale Instagram dataset and a small-scale Facebook dataset, we first conduct a multi-faceted analysis taking the interaction type, directionality and frequency into account. To this end, we explore a variety of existing and new single and multihop centrality measures. Our analysis unveils that males and females interact differently depending on the interaction types, e.g., likes or comments, and they feature different support and promotion patterns. We complement prior work showing that females do not reach top visibility (often referred to as the glass ceiling effect) jointly factoring in the connectivity and interaction intensity, both of which were previously mainly discussed independently.Inspired by these observations, we propose a novel seeding framework, called Disparity Seeding, which aims at maximizing spread while reaching a target user group, e.g., a certain percentage of females - promoting the influence of under-represented groups. Disparity Seeding ranks influential users with two gender-aware measures, the Target HI-index and the Embedding index. Extensive simulations comparing Disparity Seeding with target-agnostic algorithms show that Disparity Seeding meets the target percentage while effectively maximizing the spread. Disparity Seeding can be generalized to counter different types of inequality, e.g., race, and proactively promote minorities in the society.},

abstract = {Almost every part of the world relies on textbooks as the primary medium of imparting education. The quality of education, thus, is correlated with the quality of textbooks. In general, the quality of content in the textbooks used in the less-developed countries of the world is not up to the mark [1]. In addition to their intended purpose of delivering information, textbooks also promote behaviours that adults wish to pass on to the next generation [7]. It is, thus, important to ensure that textbooks are helpful in effective learning and do not condone undesirable social mores. The task of evaluating textbooks against these parameters is not trivial: experts must go through the entire content manually. This exercise being not only laborious, but also expensive [3]. This thesis attempts to propose a feasible computational alternative to this processThe dataset that we are working with is comprised of school textbooks collected from different boards of education of two south-east Asian countries that are widely regarded as 'developing countries'[4]. In general, a digitized textbook throws a large number of computational problems that require ideas from a number of disciplines such as Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, Human Computer Interaction and Cognitive Science. In this thesis we focus on the following research questions. Research Question 1 How can we automatically identify the text fragments that reflect gender bias from textbooks?The prevalence of gender bias has been reported in textbooks from many parts of the world [5,6]. Computational efforts to contain the effects of such biases have been proposed [2], but the detection of presence of gender bias, and identifying text passages that exhibit such biases is an unexplored problem. We model the task as a binary classification problem, with one class being biased text, and the other being unbiased text. For classifying text fragments, we propose a boosted memory-based model to learn the hidden patterns of biases from a small amount of labelled data. We are currently working on the sub-problem of identifying the gender of named human entities in textbooks in the absence of clear linguistic markers of gender such as 'sister', 'himself', etc. Our methodology is based on leveraging contextual data in the form of phrase vectors, along with sentence structure. Research Question 2 How can we enhance the learning experience of a student through an optimal ordering of concepts, and ensure the coverage of all necessary topics?We propose to represent textbook sections in the form of concept graphs [8], and utilize the linked structure of Wikipedia to determine necessary and sufficient concepts whose inclusion ensures completeness of the graph, i.e., prerequisite concepts [3] are not left out, while minimizing redundancy. For example, on the event of the presence of outgoing edges from an excluded concept C 1 to a concept C 2 included in the textbook, we suggest that C 1 be also included to ensure a comprehensive coverage of the subject matter. We also propose assigning weights to these edges, denoting the amount of dependence a concept has on another, to facilitate our aim of finding an optimal ordering of the concepts. Research Question 3 How can we automatically identify and accumulate resources of the same difficulty level as the original text from external repositories, to facilitate betterunderstanding of the content among students?Students often refer to online resources to better understand textbook content. A major hurdle associated with this practice is the wide mismatch in difficulty levels of the textbook, and the hits returned by a search engine [1]. Our aim is to learn to distinguish between texts of different levels of difficulty by using textbooks as the training data. We propose to apply a transfer learning-based approach to use the parameters learned during training to identify suitable web content. At present, we are planning to work with school-level basic science textbooks.},

abstract = {The previous papers took their research sample from the top universities, but this paper took the study sample from a local normal university in which there are 296 non-English major freshmen lack of good English-learning basis. By dint of the SPSS 25.0 analysis of the questionnaire based on the 5-point Likert scale and the digital portfolios produced by MosoTeach online teaching platform, the present study has explored the current situation of the autonomous English learning among the sample of 296 students. The findings revealed that these college freshmen exhibited the medium level of autonomous English learning (AEL) with the mean score 3.1034, which cannot be regarded as good AEL ability or bad one. As for the gender difference, there was a significant disparity between the male students’ AEL and the female students’. The mean in AEL of the female (3.1902) was superior to that of the male (2.9383). The correlation between Section 1 (self-management ability and psychology of autonomous English learning) and Section 2 (autonomous learning behaviour) in the AELS was significantly high in a positive direction with the correlation coefficient R being 0.747 and the regression model between them was established as, Y=-0.41+0.89X. However, there existed a big gap between their ability and psychology of AEL and their AEL behaviour. Meanwhile, the moderate level of AEL for these students was also testified by the digital portfolios in the MosoTeach platform. Finally, towards the situation of these students’ AEL, the countermeasure and suggestions were put forward subsequently. It is anticipated that the paper can provide implications for future studies on promoting learner autonomy in college English teaching.},

abstract = {Algorithms for social influence maximization have been extensively studied for the purpose of strategically choosing an initial set of individuals in a social network from which information gets propagated. With many applications in advertisement, news spread, vaccination, and online trend-setting, this problem is a central one in understanding how information flows in a network of individuals. As human networks may encode historical biases, algorithms performing on them might capture and reproduce such biases when automating outcomes.In this work, we study the social influence maximization problem for the purpose of designing fair algorithms for diffusion, aiming to understand the effect of communities in the creation of disparate impact among network participants based on demographic attributes (gender, race etc). We propose a set of definitions and models for assessing the fairness-utility tradeoff in designing algorithms that maximize influence through a mathematical model of diffusion and an empirical analysis of a collected dataset from Instagram. Our work shows that being feature-aware can lead to more diverse outcomes in outreach and seed selection, as well as better efficiency, than being feature-blind.},

abstract = {Online social networks (OSN) play an essential role for connecting people and allowing them to communicate online. OSN users share their thoughts, moments, and news with their network. The messages they share online can include sarcastic posts, where the intended meaning expressed by the written text is different from the literal one. This could result in miscommunication. Previous research in psycholinguistics has studied the sociocultural factors the might lead to sarcasm misunderstanding between speakers and listeners. However, there is a lack of such studies in the context of OSN. In this paper we fill this gap by performing a quantitative analysis on the influence of sociocultural variables, including gender, age, country, and English language nativeness, on the effectiveness of sarcastic communication online. We collect examples of sarcastic tweets directly from the authors who posted them. Further, we ask third-party annotators of different sociocultural backgrounds to label these tweets for sarcasm. Our analysis indicates that age, English language nativeness, and country are significantly influential and should be considered in the design of future social analysis tools that either study sarcasm directly, or look at related phenomena where sarcasm may have an influence. We also make observations about the social ecology surrounding sarcastic exchanges on OSNs. We conclude by suggesting ways in which our findings can be included in future work.},

This study sought to identify if characteristics of age, gender, weight, health, and confidence could be conveyed, using sounds created by a professional Foley artist, in three different 3D humanoid models, following a single walk cycle. An experiment was conducted with human participants (n=100) and found that Foley manipulations could convey all the intended characteristics with varying degrees of contextual success. It was shown that the abstract models were capable of communicating characteristics of age, gender, and weight. The findings are relevant to researchers and practitioners in linear and interactive media and demonstrate mechanisms by which Foley can contribute useful information and concepts about on-screen characters.},

abstract = {Monitoring advertising around controversial issues is an important step in ensuring accountability and transparency of political processes. To that end, we use the Facebook Ads Library to collect 2312 migration-related advertising campaigns in Italy over one year. Our pro- and anti-immigration classifier (F1=0.85) reveals a partisan divide among the major Italian political parties, with anti-immigration ads accounting for nearly 15M impressions. Although composing 47.6% of all migration-related ads, anti-immigration ones receive 65.2% of impressions. We estimate that about two thirds of all captured campaigns use some kind of demographic targeting by location, gender, or age. We find sharp divides by age and gender: for instance, anti-immigration ads from major parties are 17% more likely to be seen by a male user than a female. Unlike pro-migration parties, we find that anti-immigration ones reach a similar demographic to their own voters. However their audience change with topic: an ad from anti-immigration parties is 24% more likely to be seen by a male user when the ad speaks about migration, than if it does not. Furthermore, the viewership of such campaigns tends to follow the volume of mainstream news around immigration, supporting the theory that political advertisers try to “ride the wave” of current news. We conclude with policy implications for political communication: since the Facebook Ads Library does not allow to distinguish between advertisers intentions and algorithmic targeting, we argue that more details should be shared by platforms regarding the targeting configuration of socio-political campaigns.},

In the coming years, 9-1-1 services will move to integrate media-rich calling capabilities such as video-based calling. We explore how video calling services should be designed through an interview study with people who have called 9-1-1 in the past. Our results show the potential for video calling to help people who are calling 9-1-1 describe their location to call takers, show the situation at hand, receive video-based instructions, and assist in cases with language barriers. Yet video calling raises issues around anonymity, consent, culture and gender-based biases, and camera work. 9-1-1 video calling is best thought of as a collaborative act where camera work is negotiated between callers and call takers where callers are willing to hand over control of the call if their privacy concerns can be met.},

abstract = {The Australian Computer Society (ACS) and other industry bodies predict a shortfall in university graduates needed to service the growth in technical IT job roles in Australia. This shortfall is exacerbated by the paucity of females both studying IT and working in the IT sector, particularly in technical majors and careers.One of the many reasons offered for the gender disparity in technical IT fields is the gender stereotyping of IT/CS careers displayed in mass media such as TV, games, film and advertising. Our study examines the advertising material promoting IT/CS degrees in Australian universities - specifically, the testimonials given by current and past students - to determine whether themes associated with females are less technically oriented than themes surrounding males. We also investigate whether gendered messages have an impact on the attitudes of students on the suitability of technical careers for females.This paper reports on the study findings: the proportions of genders used as role models in student testimonials; the attitudes of students towards efficacy in soft skills and technical skills; and the changes in attitudes towards technical and soft-skill efficacy upon presentation of gendered role-model examples. We found that male efficacy in technical and soft skills does not appear to change, whether male or female role models are presented; while female efficacy in technical abilities changes positively when female role models are presented, even when those role models are talking about IT 'soft skills'. Implications for further research, policy and marketing in Australian universities are discussed.},

abstract = {News headlines about privacy invasions, discrimination, and biases discovered in the platforms of big technology companies are commonplace today. The headlines – ranging from comprehensive profiling of users, to microtargeting of political messages, to discrimination based on gender, race, and age – show that big tech’s operations can cause real-world harm. However, big tech companies are reluctant to disclose how they operate and typically do not give out specific information, such as what data they collect or how their algorithms make decisions. This secretive operation counteracts ideals of transparency, openness, and accountability. This tutorial will present research methods and findings from the last 5-10 years that use large-scale experiments to systematically interact with the publicly accessible elements of big tech’s platforms. These experiments allow inferring details about big tech’s hidden operations – in essence conducting meta-surveillance against big tech. For example, findings from these experiments have documented how user tracking works, the extent of tracking on the web today, and how the collected information is used for algorithmic decision-making and ad targeting.},

abstract = {Whereas social visual attention has been examined in computer-mediated (e.g., shared screen) or video-mediated (e.g., FaceTime) interaction, it has yet to be studied in mixed-media interfaces that combine video of the conversant along with other UI elements. We analyzed eye gaze of 37 dyads (74 participants) who were tasked with negotiating the price of a new car (as a buyer and seller) using mixed-media video conferencing under competitive or cooperative negotiation instructions (experimental manipulation). We used multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis to extract spatio-temporal patterns corresponding to mutual gaze (individuals look at each other), joint attention (individuals focus on the same elements of the interface), and gaze aversion (an individual looks at their partner, who is looking elsewhere). Our results indicated that joint attention predicted the sum of points attained by the buyer and seller (i.e., the joint score). In contrast, gaze aversion was associated with faster time to complete the negotiation, but with a lower joint score. Unexpectedly, mutual gaze was highly infrequent and unrelated to the negotiation outcomes and none of the gaze patterns predicted subjective perceptions of the negotiation. There were also no effects of gender composition or negotiation condition on the gaze patterns or negotiation outcomes. Our results suggest that social visual attention may operate differently in mixed-media collaborative interfaces than in face-to-face interaction. As mixed-media collaborative interfaces gain prominence, our work can be leveraged to inform the design of gaze-sensitive user interfaces that support remote negotiations among other tasks.},

abstract = {As sex robots continue to be developed by industry, portrayed by media, and studied by researchers, it is common to conceptualize robots from a cisgender and heterosexual (cishet), or feminist perspective. We advocate for an increased shift toward the 2LGBTQIA+ community for inspiration and a path forward for more inclusive, successful, and socially responsible sex robots. In addition to the intrinsic value of being inclusive, looking to the 2LGBTQIA+ community can help us to break away from traditional ideas of gender and sexuality, to unlock the full potential of this technology to be flexible and offer new possibilities. Further, we reflect on the importance of considering how the designs of sex robots, as politically charged technological artifacts, can contribute to reinforcing ideas about heteronormativity; instead, sex robots have the potential to positively contribute to breaking down traditional barriers surrounding gender and sex. We envision a future of sex robots that reach their full potential as fluid, individualized companions that enable people to comfortably engage their interests and identity.},

abstract = {Human attributes prediction in visual media is a well-researched topic with a major focus on human faces. However, face images are often of high privacy concern as they can reveal an individual's identity. How to balance this trade-off between privacy and utility is a key problem among researchers and practitioners. In this study, we make one of the first attempts to investigate the human attributes (emotion, age, and gender) prediction under the different de-identification (eyes, lower-face, face, and head obfuscation) privacy scenarios. We first constructed the Diversity in People and Context Dataset (DPaC). We then performed a human study with eye-tracking on how humans recognize facial attributes without the presence of face and context. Results show that in an image, situational context is informative of a target's attributes. Motivated by our human study, we proposed a multi-tasking deep learning model - Context-Guided Human Attributes Prediction (CHAPNet), for human attributes prediction under privacy-preserving conditions. Extensive experiments on DPaC and three commonly used benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of CHAPNet in leveraging the situational context for a better interpretation of a target's attributes without the full presence of the target's face. Our research demonstrates the feasibility of visual analytics under de-identification for privacy.},

abstract = {In this paper, we build a speech privacy attack that exploits speech reverberations from a smartphone's inbuilt loudspeaker captured via a zero-permission motion sensor (accelerometer). We design our attack Spearphone, and demonstrate that speech reverberations from inbuilt loudspeakers, at an appropriate loudness, can impact the accelerometer, leaking sensitive information about the speech. In particular, we show that by exploiting the affected accelerometer readings and carefully selecting feature sets along with off-the-shelf machine learning techniques, Spearphone can perform gender classification (accuracy over 90%) and speaker identification (accuracy over 80%) for the audio/video playback on the smartphone for our recorded dataset. We use lightweight classifiers and an off-the-shelf machine learning tool so that the attacking effort is minimized, making our attack practical. Our results with testing the attack on a voice call and voice assistant response were also encouraging, showcasing the impact of the proposed attack. In addition, we perform speech recognition and speech reconstruction to extract more information about the eavesdropped speech to an extent. Our work brings to light a fundamental design vulnerability in many currently-deployed smartphones, which may put people's speech privacy at risk while using the smartphone in the loudspeaker mode during phone calls, media playback or voice assistant interactions.},

abstract = {The exact reasons of the incidences of fatty liver disease (Hepatic Steatosis, HS) are not known. Heavy alcohol use leads to alcoholic steatohepatitis (alcoholic fatty liver disease). Contrarily, Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a condition of fat build-up in the liver when alcohol consumption is not the cause. However, certain clinical and demographic factors impact the incidence of HS. We evaluated the predictive capability of fatty liver using a computational model and NHANES-III data. Six predictor variables (age, gender, BMI, triglycerides, HDL, and total cholesterol) and one output variable (HS) were used. The challenge of class imbalanced data was handled using SMOTE algorithm combined with Gower's distance. Data were divided into training and test in 70:30 ratio with 8,903 and 3,816 observations respectively. Three families of models were trained: SVM (Fine and Medium Gaussian SVM), Bagged Trees, Boosted Tree (Gentle and ADA Boosted Tree). 10-fold cross-validation was used. Of the five models, 'Gentle Boosted Tree' model provided the highest average testing accuracy of 79.03% (79%). The average sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of the 'Gentle Boosted Tree' model were 75.88%, 81.86% and 0.79 respectively. The novelty of this paper lies in developing and testing algorithms with imbalanced data for prediction of fatty liver condition.},

abstract = {User profiling is one of the most important components in recommendation systems, where a user is profiled using demographic (e.g. gender, age, and location) and user behavior information (e.g. browsing and search history). Among different dimensions of user profiling, tagging is an explainable and widely-used representation of user interest. In this paper, we propose a user tag profiling model (UTPM) to study user-tag profiling as a multi-label classification task using deep neural networks. Different from the conventional model, our UTPM model is a multi-head attention mechanism with shared query vectors to learn sparse features across different fields. Besides, we introduce the improved FM-based cross feature layer, which outperforms many state-of-the-art cross feature methods and further enhances model performance. Meanwhile, we design a novel joint method to learn the preference of different tags from a single clicked news article in recommendation systems. Furthermore, our UTPM model is deployed in the WeChat "Top Stories" recommender system, where both online and offline experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over baseline models.},

abstract = {This study investigated patterns in the development of computational thinking and programming expertise in the context of the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) program, a high school introductory CS course and professional development program designed to foster deep engagement through equitable inquiry around CS concepts. Prior research on programming expertise has identified three general areas of development --- program comprehension, program planning, and program generation. The pedagogical practices in ECS are consistent with problem solving approaches that support the development of programming expertise. The study took place in a large urban district during the 2016--17 school year with 28 ECS teachers and 1,931 students. A validated external assessment was used to measure the development of programming expertise. The results indicate that there were medium-sized, statistically significant increases from pretest to posttest, and there were no statistically significant differences by gender or race/ethnicity. After controlling for prior academic achievement, performance in the ECS course correlated with performance on the posttest. With respect to specific programming concepts, the results also provide evidence on the progression of the development of programming expertise. Students seem to develop comprehension and planning expertise prior to expertise in program generation. In addition, students seem to develop expertise with concrete tasks prior to abstract tasks.},

abstract = {Political campaigns are increasingly turning to targeted advertising platforms to inform and mobilize potential voters. The appeal of these platforms stems from their promise to empower advertisers to select (or "target") users who see their messages with great precision, including through inferences about those users' interests and political affiliations. However, prior work has shown that the targeting may not work as intended, as platforms' ad delivery algorithms play a crucial role in selecting which subgroups of the targeted users see the ads. In particular, the platforms can selectively deliver ads to subgroups within the target audiences selected by advertisers in ways that can lead to demographic skews along race and gender lines, and do so without the advertiser's knowledge. In this work we demonstrate that ad delivery algorithms used by Facebook, the most advanced targeted advertising platform, shape the political ad delivery in ways that may not be beneficial to the political campaigns and to societal discourse. In particular, the ad delivery algorithms lead to political messages on Facebook being shown predominantly to people who Facebook thinks already agree with the ad campaign's message even if the political advertiser targets an ideologically diverse audience. Furthermore, an advertiser determined to reach ideologically non-aligned users is non-transparently charged a high premium compared to their more aligned competitor, a difference from traditional broadcast media. Our results demonstrate that Facebook exercises control over who sees which political messages beyond the control of those who pay for them or those who are exposed to them. Taken together, our findings suggest that the political discourse's increased reliance on profit-optimized, non-transparent algorithmic systems comes at a cost of diversity of political views that voters are exposed to. Thus, the work raises important questions of fairness and accountability desiderata for ad delivery algorithms applied to political ads.},

abstract = {The story-stem approach is a reliable and valid method in child psychiatry for investigating children’s social understanding, such as in family/peer relationships. Research is on-going into automating the use of story-stems as the approach takes a lot of time and there are often few administrators trained to administer them. A key part of automation is detecting if a child is engaged in the story-stems; if the child is not engaged, then automated techniques will not work. The study focuses on measuring child engagement using observed facial expressions and specifically on understanding the effect of multimedia digital story-stems on their engagement levels to create a better and more engaging digital story-stem. This ensures that psychiatrists who assess story stems with videos will know whether the child involved is engaged with the story-stems and can be assessed properly. The spontaneous facial expressions of 40 children were collected while watching digital story-stems using an RGB video camera and their engagement levels can be automatically classified using observed facial expressions. Meanwhile, we look at different styles of voice (gender and expressiveness) and video format (animation vs live-action recorded) in the story-stems to see how this affected child engagement. The distribution of child engagement across different media types was compared and the results showed that children were more engaged in a story-stem narrated by a female expressive voice. While comparing the two video formats, although children were more engaged in the current version of animated videos, there were still some factors, such as doll appearance, to be investigated for the design of story-stems.},

abstract = {Understanding user characteristics such as demographic information is useful for the personalization of online content promoted to users. However, it is difficult to obtain such data for each user visiting the website. Since demographic data for some users can be collected, their behavior can be used to predict the attributes of unknown users. Through online news consumption, we can infer the attributes of users from the articles they view. Most existing models take a supervised learning approach to this modeling task. However, by representing the user-URL interactions with a network, we can convert it to a semi-supervised learning problem and learn embeddings for users. Graph embeddings have become popular in recent years, with research mainly focusing on algorithmic developments. However, while we have an intuitive understanding of the problems they may overcome, such as data sparsity, this problem remains unexplored in the domain of demographic prediction using behavior. In this paper, we first investigate the effectiveness of using user embeddings generated from network representation learning for prediction by comparing its performance with other traditional feature sets, including content and item-based features. We find that the embeddings can represent a user generally on two prediction tasks, (1) gender prediction (classification) and (2) age prediction (regression). Second, we explore the advantages of using these embeddings over the other methods in two cases of data sparsity, where (1) the training and testing sets of users are temporally split and (2) the user labels are imbalanced. In both these cases, the embeddings outperform the baseline.},

In order to understand the weak points of knowledge, attitudes and practices towards seasonal influenza and its vaccine among high school students, a cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted in Connecticut.Methods: From March to May, 2018, a close-ended self-administered questionnaire with 24 multiple choice questions about the knowledge, attitudes and practices towards seasonal influenza and vaccine was distributed to all the enrolled students in Suffield Academy, Connecticut. The knowledge score was calculated for each student, which was compared across demographic categories. Factors associated with uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine were explored using multivariate logistic regression.Results: 60% of the students responded to the questionnaire, of whom 228 were included in analysis. The number of respondents was balanced across grades, of whom 10.5% were international students. The average knowledge score was 11.6±1.4 out of 14 points. The score of international students was significantly lower than that of domestic students (p&lt;0.001). Only 56.6% of students recognized that flu might cause serious complications, and nearly 60% mistakenly believed flu could be transmitted by food or blood. Most students get their flu knowledge from school (68.4%), while other information sources like public media and internet were underused. 84.2% and 57.9% students believed in the safety and effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccine, while few students felt a high risk to get a flu or to develop into severe illness (25.4% and 9.6% respectively). Respondents showed good compliance to preventive behaviors like wash hands and avoid contact with patients, and 60.1% of them got the flu shot annually in the past 3 years. High knowledge scores (OR=1.34, 95% CI 1.05-1.72), high perceived vaccine safety (OR=4.01, 95% CI 1.60-10.00) and effectiveness (OR=2.37, 95% CI 1.26-4.45) were significantly associated with vaccine uptake behavior after adjusting for gender, grade and nationality. The main reason for no vaccination was afraid of the pain of injection, while financial cost was the least consideration. The most persuasive messages focused on the direct and indirect benefits of the vaccine.Conclusion: More knowledge of influenza and positive attitudes towards the safety and effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine are positive predictors for vaccine uptake. Students tend to underestimate the risk of infection and the severity of the illness, and have misconception on the transmission mode of influenza. Future health promotion activities should improve the weak points of knowledge and emphasize the benefits of vaccination, with more attention paid to international student study in the US.},

abstract = {The phenakisistcope was the first device to invoke phantom machine motion in repetitive-loop animations. Almost as soon as it was invented, Alfonse Giroux produced for the phenakistiscope a set of pornographic animations of delirious inventiveness. As though an early 19th-century Donna Haraway, he imagines transgressions of the boundaries between human and animal, human and machine, male and female (a continuous-loop gender reassignment) as well as between pleasure and pain. I explore the origins and implications of this inventiveness, so much in advance of the mid-19th-century crystallization of categories of sexual transgression. Giroux's celebration of female desire and volition suggests an inspiration from Fourier's mechanics of passional attraction rather than de Sade.More intriguing is the inspiration from the machinic medium itself. The phenaskistiscope was understood as a machine that represented non-mimetically in a way that seems to have released the imagination. Many of the early images for it were pure machinic abstractions. Giroux's images were largely masturbatory. Pistons relentlessly thrusting, gears endlessly meshing in pointless circular motion seemed to invoke an auto-erotic machine self-referentiality. The first human actions to be represented were those of labouring bodies already reduced to their machine-like components and semi-automated. Women performed repetitive tasks of domestic labour, including spanking, unendingly. The eroticism of machine discipline and power also animates Giroux's imagination.The construction of phenakistiscope motion involves analysis and reassembly. It allows for the virtual simplification and rationalization of work and working bodies as well as sex and sexual embodiments. These affordances allowed for the release of an inventiveness concerning the possibilities of human desire and the plasticity of the desiring body. Giroux creates for it perhaps the first techno-dream of endless erotic abundance and the escape of the limitations of one's sexual embodiment.},
